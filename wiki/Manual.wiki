#summary GUARDD Manual itemizes essential program functions

== Contents == 
<wiki:toc max_depth="5" />

== Goals == 
  * Background on general use and limitations
  * Itemize details of GUARDD features


== Describing dispersions ==
 * Equations
 * Intensity -> R2eff
 * R2eff(vcpmg) -> paramters required
 * Quantum coherence

== Organizing data ==


=== Dataset ===
  * *Goal*: _Describe a series CPMG NMR data under a set of experimental conditions_
  * Properties
    * *name*: _Name of dataset (e.g., 'MQ 800MHz 25C')_
    * *AX_String*: _13C or 15N_
    * *B0*: _Magnetic field strength (^1^H MHz)_
    * *Temp*: _Temperature (K)_
    * *TCPMG*: _Total CPMG time in pulse sequence_
    * *SQX*: _True=Single Quantum dataset (Δω,,H,, fixed to zero), False=Multiple Quantum dataset (Δω,,H,, may be non-zero)_
  * Data for each dispersion curve
    * Intensity values and errors
    * R2eff values and errors
    * ν,,CPMG,, values
    * Pointers to [Curve Curves] which also hold this information

=== Curve ===
  * *Goal*: _Describe an NMR dispersion curve (R,,2,,^Eff^(ν,,CPMG,,)) under a set of experimental conditions corresponding to its parentDataset_

  * Each curve is unique
  * Curves cannot be copied, but multiple _appearances_ can be created (e.g., in different groups)
  * Each appearance of a curve merely _points_ to the same source data
  * Any changes to a curve will alter every apperance of that curve (e.g., in all the groups it is part of)

  * Each curve is described by 4-5 parameters
    # Δω,,H,, (MQ only; for SQ, Δω,,H,, is fixed to zero)
    # Δω,,X,,
    # P,,A,,
    # k,,ex,,
    # R,,2,,^0^

=== Curveset ===
  * *Goal*: _Describe a *set* of curves (same NMR probe/assignment) using a single pair of chemical shift differences (Δω,,H,, and Δω,,C,,)_

=== Group ===
  * *Goal*: _Describe a *group* of curvesets (multiple NMR probes) using a single set of exchange kinetics (P,A, and k,,ex,, at each temperature)_

=== Assigning parameters for fitting ===

  * Check the command window output for itemization of each parameter

=== FitResult ===


=== RateAnalysis ===


=== Examples for fitting ===



== Main window ==

== Input ==

=== Clear session ===
  * Clears the session, as if the program was just opened

=== Load session ===
  * Clears the current session
  * Loads a previously saved GUARDD session (a ".mat" MATLAB variables file)
  * This may take a relatively long time to load
    * 1 Mb file takes ~0.5 min
    * 10 Mb file takes ~5 min

=== Settings ===
  * Change program settings here
  * Take special note of OUTPUT_DEBUG flags, which are helpful to see program logic during execution
  * The items on this list are set in the code via {{{Session.param_info}}}

=== Data Manger ===
  * *Goal*: _Manage datasets, curves, curvesets, and groups for analysis (input and basic output)_

  * *Input...*
    * *Script...*
      * Loads a script file [http://code.google.com/p/guardd/w/edit.do#Input:_Script_file_to_load_data here]
    * *Sequence file...*
      * Load a sequence file [http://code.google.com/p/guardd/w/edit.do#Input:_Sequence_file here]
    * *Dataset...*
      * *Sort curves (this dataset)* → Curves sorted by {{{index}}} and {{{atom}}} are easier to browse
      * *Sort curves (all datasets)*
    * *Group...*
      * *Sort groups* → Groups sorted by {{{index}}} and {{{name}}} are easier to browse
    * *Curveset...*
    * *Curve...*
    * *Output...*
