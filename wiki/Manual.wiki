      * Define ΔH for temperature-dependence of P,,A,, (vant Hoff)
      * Define E,,AB,, for temperature-dependence of k,,A,, and, using ΔH, k,,B,, and therefore k,,ex,, = k,,A,,+k,,B,, (Arrhenius), and therefore k,,ex,, = k,,A,,+k,,B,,

=== Chemical exchange phenomenon ===
_Adapted from Kleckner and Foster, 2010_

  * Certain dynamic processes in the μs-ms time window lead to characteristic broadening of the NMR signal
  * This "exchange broadening" can obscure the observables and in some cases render the NMR signal undetectable
  * However, this contains valuable information on the underlying dynamic process
  * The relaxation dispersion (RD) NMR experiment can access this information by use of a spin-echo pulse train

=== The RD experiment refocuses chemical exchange broadening R,,ex,, ===
_From Kleckner and Foster, 2010_

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-CPMG_RD/figure-CPMG_RD--experiment.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-CPMG_RD/figure-CPMG_RD--experiment.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="200"> </img> </a> 

  * Carr-Purcell Meiboom-Gill Relaxation Dispersion (CPMG RD) uses spin-echo pulse trains to suppress relaxation due to exchange processes on the µs-ms timescale.
  * *(a)* The number of spin-echo pulses applied during the fixed relaxation time directly determines the CPMG frequency via ν,,CPMG,, = 1 / (4τ).
    * The applied CPMG pulse train is shown above each relaxation delay (ν,,CPMG,, = 100, 500 and 1100 Hz).
    * These pulses reduce the signal relaxation rate during the relaxation delay by refocusing exchange broadening (i.e., reducing R,,ex,,).
  * *(b)* The observed signal intensity remaining at the end of the TCPMG relaxation delay is used to obtain an effective relaxation rate , where I,,0,, is the signal intensity in the absence of the relaxation delay (i.e., when TCPMG = 0).
  * *(c)* The dispersion curve reports on dynamics by plotting relaxation rate as a function of refocusing frequency.
    * R,,2,,^Obs^ is altered in a ν,,CPMG,,-frequency-dependent manner such that significant refocusing is typically achieved when ν,,CPMG,, exceeds half the exchange rate k,,ex,,.
    * *The observed relationship between site-specific R,,2,,^Obs^ and ν,,CPMG,, is used to fit an exchange model described by*
      *the chemical shift differences between the exchanging states Δν = Δω / (2π)
      * the population fraction of the A state P,,A,, with P,,A,, + P,,B,, = 1
      * the total exchange rate between the states k,,ex,, = k,,A,, + k,,B,,,
      * the intrinsic relaxation rate in the absence of exchange R,,2,,^0^, which 
      * *Note*: _R,,2,,^0^ can be used to determine the exchange broadening R,,ex,,_
    * This dispersion curve is simulated using Δν = 400 Hz, P,,A,, = 90%, k,,ex,, = 400 /s, R,,2,,^0^ = 10 Hz
      * *Note*: _The R,,2,,^Obs^ curve begins to "break" at ν,,CPMG,, = k,,ex,, / 2 = 200 /s_
    * Three ν,,CPMG,, values from (a) and (b) marked with vertical arrows

== Two-state exchange model ==

  * *Structural parameters (1 or 2 per NMR probe)*
    # |Δω,,H,,| (rad/s): Magnitude of ^1^H chemical shift difference between A and B states (for MQ curves only)
    # |Δω,,X,,| (rad/s): Magnitude of ^A^X chemical shift difference between A and B states (AX = ^13^C or ^15^N)
  * *Kinetic parameters (2 per temperature per NMR probe)*
    * Parameters used in fitting equations
      # k,,ex,, (/s): Total exchange rate between state A and B; k,,ex,, = k,,A,, + k,,B,, 
      # P,,A,, (-): Population fraction of state A; P,,A,, = k,,B,, / (k,,A,,+k,,B,,) with P,,A,, + P,,B,, = 1
    * Alternate physical parameterization, which requires knowledge of both k,,ex,, and P,,A,,
      # k,,A,, (/s): Average frequency (not velocity!) of transition from state A to state B
      # k,,B,, (/s): Average frequency (not velocity!) of transition from state B to state A
  * *Relaxation parameter (1 per curve per NMR probe)*
    # R,,2,,^0^ (Hz): Relaxation rate of the A state in the absence of exchange 

== Assigning parameters for fitting ==
  * *Goal*: _Fitting RD data requries five parameters per curve, but often these parameters can be shared when they are aggregated into curvesets, which are aggregated into groups_
    * Details on Curves, Curvesets, and Groups are [Manual#Organizing_Data here]

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/data_management-example/figure-data_management-example.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/data_management-example/figure-data_management-example.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="200"> </img> </a> 

  * Each *Curve* is described by 4-5 parameters
    # |Δω,,H,,| = ^1^H chemical shift difference between states A and B (ppm, rad/s, Hz)
      * *Note*: For SQ curves, Δω,,H,, is fixed to zero and therefore does not need to be specified in a fit
    # |Δω,,X,,| = ^A^X chemical shift difference between states A and B (ppm, rad/s, Hz)
    # P,,A,, = Population fraction of A state (fraction, %)
    # k,,ex,, = k,,A,, + k,,B,, = Total exchange rate between states (/s)
    # R,,2,,^0^ = Transverse relaxation rate in the absence of exchange (Hz)
    * *Assume*: Relaxation rates of states A and B are equal (R,,2A,,^0^ = R,,2B,,^0^)

  * Curves are aggregated into *Curvesets*, which all share the same chemical shift differences |Δω,,H,,| and |Δω,,X,,|
    * *Assume*: |Δω,,H,,| (ppm) and |Δω,,X,,| (ppm) are independent of temperature
      * Therefore, each unique temperature yields an independent measure of |Δω,,H,,| and/or |Δω,,X,,|
    * *NMR*: Resonance frequency scales with magnetic field strength
      * Therefore, each unique B,,0,, field yields an independent measure of |Δω,,X,,|
      * See calculations [Manual#Converting_ppm_to_rad/s here]
    * *NMR*: An experiment may be designed to detect a particular quantum coherence
      * Therefore, each unique quantum coherence yields an independent measure of |Δω,,H,,| and/or |Δω,,X,,|
      * Single Quantum (SQ) experiments are sensitive to only |Δω,,H,,| or |Δω,,X,,|
      * Multiple Quantum (MQ) experiments are sensitive to the sum |Δω,,H,, + Δω,,X,,|      
      * See Korzhnev, et al. (2005) for more information: [Manual#References Quantum Coherences in dispersion]

  * Curvesets are aggregated into *Groups*, which all share the same kinetic parameters (P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at each temperature)
    * *Physics*: Kinetic parameters are determined by experimental conditions
      * E.g., temperature, buffer, sometimes concentration but NOT magnetic field strength
      * Therefore, each repeat condition (same or different B,,0,,) yields an independent measure of P,,A,, and k,,ex,,
    * There are at least *two methods* to specify P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at each temperature
    * Method A - No constraint on rate analysis
      * Define P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at each temperature explicitly
    * Method B - Constrain rate analysis via ΔH and E,,AB,,
      * Define P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at a single temperature, T,,0,,
      * Define ΔH for temperature-dependence of P,,A,, (vant Hoff)
      * Define E,,AB,, for temperature-dependence of k,,A,, and, using ΔH, k,,B,, and therefore k,,ex,, = k,,A,,+k,,B,, (Arrhenius)
    * See calculations [Manual#Arrhenius:_Determining_activation_energy here]

=== Examples of parameter assignment ===
  * *Goal*: _Check the command window output for itemization of each parameter in a given group_
    * Use the debugging output option {{{OUTPUT_DEBUG_UPDATE_FIT_PARAMS}}} (in [Manual#Settings Settings window], on by default)

=== Fitting data ===
 * *Goal*: _Minimize the sum of squares target function_

  * *Location in code*: {{{FitResult.fitMe()}}}

  * Reference: MATLAB {{{fmincon}}}



=== Basic Statistics ===
  To fit dispersion data, this program minimizes a target function quantifying the goodness of fit
  Here, the goodness of fit is quantified by either χ2 or SSE

  [formula] is the "chi squared" metric
  [formula] is the "sum of squred errors" metric

  [formula] is the total number of observations
  [formula] is the calculated value for the ith data point
  [formula] represents the values of each adjustable model parameter
  [formula] is the observed value for the ith data point
  [formula] is the experimental uncertainty in the ith data point


  Both χ2 and SSE become smaller as the curve fit more closely matches the observed data
  χ2 is normalized to errors in measurement (SSE is not) and each can be used for statistical tests

  Note: This program uses χ2 but SSE may appear in notes and source code as they are conceptually identical in some respects
  (E.g., both are minimized at "best fit")

==== Display Chi2 Map ====
 * *Question*: _What is a good fit look like?_

  * *Key info on features of chi2 maps*    
    * _The Chi2 map displays a parameter value on the X-axis and the goodness of fit (χ^2^) on the Y-axis_
    * _Lower value of χ^2^ indicates a more precise fit to the data_
    * Single-valued maps reflect a very well-defined fitting solution (easy for the MATLAB solver to find the best result)
    * U- or V-shaped maps reflect a defined fitting solution, but have rough local features which trap the MATLAB solver)
    * Flat maps reflect a poorly-defined fitting solution (parameter is not OK), and have rough local features which trap the MATLAB solver
    * Chi2 maps may exhibit several of these features at once
      * Example: two focused points of solutions (_which one is best??_)
      * Example: two U-shaped set of points which point to different solutions (_which one is best??_)
      * Example: a flat portion within some range of parameter values, and a single point at an anomalous fitted value (e.g., P,,A,,=50%)
      * Example: a flat portion within some range of parameter values, and a U-shaped well reflecting a local set of solutions
    * *Details*: Read more about the grid search in the [Manual#Grid_Search Manual]

===== The importance of the Grid Search + Chi2 Map =====

  * Introduction: Fitting dispersion data
  * It is not sufficient so just visually inspect the curve fit
  * Examining the shape of χ2 space is important to select the most accurate fit
  * In many cases, a plot of χ2 vs. Fitted Parameter is U-shaped
  * The optimal parameter value is at the horizontal center of the U and yields a value of χ2 at the bottom of the U
  * In practice, χ2 space may deviate from the U-shape and thus complicate the optimization process
  * This software is powerful because it allows the user to view the χ2 space and drive the fit towards the most accurate solution
  * Below, there are several commonly encountered forms of χ2 space with solutions to obtain an accurate result

  * General issues
  * χ2 minimum is not well defined compared to other candidate minima
  * Noisy dispersion data and/or small Rex

  * General solutions
  * (1) Extract maximum information from current fit of current data
  * If some parameters are defined, mark only them as "OK" in fitting window
  * Usually R20 and Rex can be obtained despite ill-defined PA and/or kex and/or Δω

  * (2) Alter fit to extract maximum information from current data
  * Eliminate noisy dispersion curves and re-fit the curve set
  * Compare values of kex and PA at site α to those at another site β which is close in structure / sequence
  * If sites α and β report the same process, they will both report the same kex and PA, but not necessarily the same Δω or R20
  * Note: global fit of data from multiple sites is not available in this version of the program (August 2010)

  * (3) Acquire more dispersion data and re-fit with new data
  * Different experimental conditions (e.g., temperature)
  * Different magnetic resonance conditions (quantum coherence, magnetic field)


  * It is important that all the interpretations be deemed trustworthy
  * If there is unceratinty, simply do not use any fit from this residue (or mark it as such)


===== Select fit from grid search =====

===== Display Monte Carlo Errors =====
 * *Key info on Monte Carlo analysis*
    * The goal of MC analysis is to generate and fit many *synthetic* datasets which differ from one another by an amount related to the goodness of fit to the original data
    * Each synthetic dataset will have a different set of optimal fit values (e.g., P,,A,,, k,,ex,,)
    * The distribution of fitted values reflects the degree to which the original data define its *own* optimal values
    * Example: A worse optimal fit to the original data yields *more different* MC datasets and therefore *more different* optimal parameter values
    * *Details*: Read more about Monte Carlo error estimation in the [Manual#Monte_Carlo_error_estimation Manual]

== Tips for optimal use ==




=== General tips ===
    * If unsure about the fit, then don't use it
    * Additional inaccurate information will likely obscure proper interpretation of the dynamics
    * Check for outliers in fitted data
          o Check sequence mapping for outliers
          o Check χ2 and fits for those outliers
          o Are they real?
          o What type of exchange do proximal residues exhibit?
    * Note: Important tool tips can be revealed by hovering the mouse cursor over an element of the program

=== Fitting tips ===
    * Usually dispersions with larger R,,ex,, have a more well-defined solution
    * Small R,,ex,, and/or noisy data are usually accompanied by challenges in fitting
    * It is NOT SUFFICIENT to simply check if the fitted curve passes through the data
    * Neighboring residues
          o Check dispersions for neighboring residues to get an idea of the type of motions one may expect in that region of the structure
          o If there is concerted motion, then k,,ex,, and Pa (and their temperature-dependence Ea(A → B), Ea (B → A), dH, dS) will be the same (or close) for residues close in structure
          o Note: There is no requirement that neighboring residues be similar though
    * Aim to select the fit in the minimum and center of the χ2 well
          o If the grid is sparse, use the χ2-fitting tool to help
          o Zoom in on regions of χ2 space to get a better idea of setting initial conditions
          o Use the data cursor to examine specific values of (P,χ2)
          o FIGURE OF ZOOM + DATA CURSOR
    * k,,ex,, is most sensitive parameter
          o k,,ex,, should increase with temperature (e.g., Arrhenius)
          o Pa may increase (dH<0), decrease (dH>0) or remain constant (dH=0) with temperature
    * Goal: Determine whether curve set exhibits exchange or not
          o Statistical comparison of NoEx and Grid fits
          o Which has lower MSE (χ2Red)? → Statistically favored fit
          o Is R,,ex,, > 2 Hz → Exchange is reasonable
          o Smaller R,,ex,, values are challenging to fit
          o These may hint at some parameters for exchange
    * Goal: Refine best fit for maximum accuracy
          o Examine χ2-space to determine quality of fit
          o For RD there are a variety of typical shapes encountered
          o Check k,,ex,, first then P,,A,,
          o Zoom in on χ2 space
          o Examine top 80%, top 50%, top 20%, top 10%
          o Top 80% may reveal otherwise-unseen reasonable solution
          o They should reveal decreasing range of acceptable fit values
          o Matlab fitting algorithm is good at finding best Δω from starting condition
          o It is NOT good at finding best k,,ex,,
          o Therefore it is important to help direct the fit towards the best k,,ex,,
          o Select initial fit conditions to drive fitting process towards most reasonable solution
          o Try k,,ex,, towards a more reasonable solution with existing P,,A,,'s
          o Try again with all P,,A,,'s equal at 0.9 or 0.99
          o k,,ex,, should double for each 10C increase in temperature (Arrhenius)


=== Analysis tips ===
    * Goal: Examine dynamic motion of entire molecule
          o Use sequence mapping tool
          o Find outlying fit results and re-examine fits to dispersions
          o Check fits for crosspeaks which exhibit maximum k,,ex,,, Δω,,X,,, ΔH and ΔS
          o All activation energies should be positive
          o If not, adjust fit so k,,A,, and k,,B,, increases with temperature (~2x per +10C)
          o k,,A,, = P,,B,,*k,,ex,,; k,,B,, = P,,A,,*k,,ex,,
          o If this is not possible, then reject fit as “not good”
          o Make sure fits which show no exchange have “NoEx” model selected as best
          o When using data cursor, make sure you are selecting the actual data bar (it is possible to select the edge of the errorbar and therefore indicate the adjacent data point)
          o It can help to zoom in on the data to avoid this mistake


=== Program tips ===
    * Do not make other changes when performing grid search or error estimates
          o Data can be viewed but not altered
          o This is because data structures are stored before the batch run (or a single grid search or single error estimation) then re-saved upon completion of a batch step or single grid search or single error estimation
    * Save frequently
    * Drawing windows is relatively slow
          o Use the main display window to only update displays of interest
