#summary GUARDD Manual itemizes essential program functions

== Contents == 
<wiki:toc max_depth="5" />

== Goals == 
  * Background on general use and limitations
  * Itemize details of GUARDD features


== Describing dispersions ==
 * Equations
 * Intensity -> R2eff
 * R2eff(vcpmg) -> paramters required
 * Quantum coherence

== Organizing data ==


=== Dataset ===
  * *Goal*: _Describe a series CPMG NMR data under a set of experimental conditions_

  * Properties
    * *name*: _Name of dataset (e.g., 'MQ 800MHz 25C')_
    * *AX_String*: _13C or 15N_
    * *B0*: _Magnetic field strength (^1^H MHz)_
    * *Temp*: _Temperature (K)_
    * *TCPMG*: _Total CPMG time in pulse sequence_
    * *SQX*: _True=Single Quantum dataset (Δω,,H,, fixed to zero), False=Multiple Quantum dataset (Δω,,H,, may be non-zero)_

  * Data for each dispersion curve
    * Intensity values and errors
    * R2eff values and errors
    * ν,,CPMG,, values
    * Pointers to [Manual#Curve Curves] which also hold this information

=== Curve ===
  * *Goal*: _Hold data for an NMR dispersion curve (R,,2,,^Eff^(ν,,CPMG,,)) under a set of experimental conditions corresponding to its parentDataset_

  * Properties
    * *name*: _Name of the curve (e.g., 'Leu 12\delta_2')_
    * *index*: _Residue number_
    * *atom*: _Name of atom (N, H\alpha, C\delta_1, etc.)_
    * *residue*: _Name of residue (Ile, Leu, Arg, etc.)_

  * Properties from its parent [Manual#Dataset Dataset] (copied to each curve for convenience)
    * *AX_String*: _13C or 15N_
    * *B0*: _Magnetic field strength (^1^H MHz)_
    * *Temp*: _Temperature (K)_
    * *TCPMG*: _Total CPMG time in pulse sequence_
    * *SQX*: _True=Single Quantum dataset (Δω,,H,, fixed to zero), False=Multiple Quantum dataset (Δω,,H,, may be non-zero)_    

  * Data from its parent [Manual#Dataset Dataset]  (copied to each curve for convenieice)
    * *Nobs*: _Number of observations_    
    * *vcpmg*: _Array of vcpmg values (Hz)_
    * *R2eff*: _Array of R2eff values (Hz)_
    * *eR2eff*: _Array of errors in R2eff (Hz)_

  * Each curve is unique, but can have multiple _appearances_, each of which points to the same source data
    * Multiple _appearances_ can occur in different [Manual#Curveset Curvesets]    
    * Any changes to a curve will alter every apperance of that curve (e.g., in all curvesets that point to it)

  * Each curve is described by 4-5 parameters
    # Δω,,H,, (MQ only; for SQ, Δω,,H,, is fixed to zero)
    # Δω,,X,,
    # P,,A,,
    # k,,ex,,
    # R,,2,,^0^

=== Curveset ===
  * *Goal*: _Describe a *set* of curves (same NMR probe/assignment) using a single pair of chemical shift differences (Δω,,H,, and Δω,,C,,)_

  * Properties
    * *name*: _Name of curve set_
    * *index*: _Residue number_        
    * *atom*: _Name of atom (N, H\alpha, C\delta_1, etc.)_
    * *residue*: _Name of residue (Ile, Leu, Arg, etc.)_

  * Curvesets contain _pointers_ to curves (selected from Datasets)
    * *Nc*: _Number of curves in the curveset_
    * Pointers to [Manual#Curve Curves] which hold the actual data and experimental conditions

  * Each curveset only appears *once* (unlike Curves)    

=== Group ===
  * *Goal*: _Describe a *group* of curvesets (multiple NMR probes) using a single set of exchange kinetics (P,A, and k,,ex,, at each temperature), and all the fits to the group_

  * Properties
    * *name*: _Name of group_
    * *index*: _Index of the group (for sorting; this may correspond to residue number)_

  * Storage of fitting results
    * *exhibitsExchange*: _This group exhibits exchange (true/false)_
    * *bestFitIsOK*: _The best fit to this group is OK (true/false)_
    * *Nf*: _Number of fit results_
    * *fitResults_Grid*: _Array of FitResults for the grid search_
    * *fitResults*: _Array of FitResults for arbitrary fits (ex and no-ex)_
    * *fitResult_NoEx*: _Fit result to no exchange model_
    * *fitResult_Best*: _Best fit result out of all fits (ex and no-ex)_

  * Groups contain _pointers_ to [Manual#Curveset Curvesets], each of which only appears once
  * Each group points to a parent [Manual#Session Session] which contains settings, etc.

=== Session ===
  * *Goal*: _Store program data, settings, etc._

=== Assigning parameters for fitting ===

  * Check the command window output for itemization of each parameter

=== FitResult ===


=== RateAnalysis ===


=== Examples for fitting ===



== Main window ==

== Input ==

=== Clear session ===
  * Clears the session, as if the program was just opened

=== Load session ===
  * Clears the current session
  * Loads a previously saved GUARDD session (a ".mat" MATLAB variables file)
  * This may take a relatively long time to load
    * 1 Mb file takes ~0.5 min
    * 10 Mb file takes ~5 min

=== Settings ===
  * Change program settings here
  * Take special note of OUTPUT_DEBUG flags, which are helpful to see program logic during execution
  * The items on this list are set in the code via {{{Session.param_info}}}

=== Data Manger ===
  * *Goal*: _Manage datasets, curves, curvesets, and groups for analysis (input and basic output)_

  * *Input...*
    * *Script...*
      * Loads a script file [FileFormats#Input:_Script_file_to_load_data here]
    * *Sequence file...*
      * Load a sequence file [FileFormats#Input:_Sequence_file here]
    * *Dataset...*
      * *Sort curves (this dataset)* → Curves sorted by {{{index}}} and {{{atom}}} are easier to browse
      * *Sort curves (all datasets)*
    * *Group...*
      * *Sort groups* → Groups sorted by {{{index}}} and {{{name}}} are easier to browse
    * *Curveset...*
