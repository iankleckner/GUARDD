=== Scientific questions addressed by RD NMR ===

  * *Question*: Is this molecule flexible in the μs-ms time window?
    * *Answer*: via R,,ex,, from visual inspection of single RD NMR experiment

  * *Question*: If so, what is the nature of this exchange process?
    * *Note*: Typically, exchange processes are considered as at least one site of a single molecule which occupies at least two distinct local structures (AKA states or configurations), denoted A and B [Manual#Two-state_exchange_model link]

  * *Question*: What is the chemical environment (e.g., structure) of this alternate configuration?
    * *Answer*: via chemical shift difference Δω obtained from at least one RD NMR experiment [Manual#Two-state_exchange_model link]

  * *Question*: On average, how often is this alternate configuration sampled?
    * *Answer*:  via total exchange rate k,,ex,, from at least one RD NMR experiment [Manual#Two-state_exchange_model link]

  * *Question*: What is the relative population of this alternate configuration?
    * *Answer*: via population P,,A,, from at least one RD NMR experiment [Manual#Two-state_exchange_model link]

  * *Question*: How much activation energy is required to access this alternate configuration?
    * *Answer*: via activation energies E(A→B) and E(B→A) from several RD experiments (Arrhenius analysis) [Manual#Arrhenius:_Determining_activation_energy link]

  * *Question*: What is the relative energy, enthalpy and entropy of this alternate configuration?
    * *Answer*: via energy ΔG (via P,,A,,), enthalpy ΔH, entropy ΔS from several RD experiments (van't Hoff analysis) [Manual#vant_Hoff:_Determining_enthalpy link]

  * *Question*: Is the alternate configuration a well-defined fold? Is it unfolded?
    * *Answer*: via chemical shift difference Δω, enthalpy ΔH, entropy ΔS from several RD experiments (See Kleckner & Foster, 2011 [Manual#References here])

  * *Question*: Are motions in this molecule unified, coupled or independent?
    * *Answer*: via exchange rates k,,A,, and k,,B,,, enthalpy ΔH, entropy ΔS and activation energies E(A→B) and E(B→A) for several sites from several RD experiments (See Kleckner & Foster, 2011 [Manual#References here])


=== Chemical exchange phenomenon ===
  * *Goal*: _Present the NMR phenomenon that enables characterization of μs-ms dynamics_

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-chemical_exchange/figure-chem_exchange_NMR-GUARDD.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-chemical_exchange/figure-chem_exchange_NMR-GUARDD.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="200"> </img> </a> 

_Adapted from Kleckner and Foster, 2011_

  * Certain dynamic processes in the μs-ms time window lead to characteristic broadening of the NMR signal
  * This "exchange broadening" can obscure the observables and in some cases render the NMR signal undetectable
  * However, this contains valuable information on the underlying dynamic process
  * The relaxation dispersion (RD) NMR experiment can access this information by use of a spin-echo pulse train

=== The RD experiment refocuses chemical exchange broadening R,,ex,, ===
  * *Goal*: _Present the NMR experiment that quantitatively characterizes μs-ms dynamics_

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-CPMG_RD/figure-CPMG_RD--experiment.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-CPMG_RD/figure-CPMG_RD--experiment.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="200"> </img> </a> 

_From Kleckner and Foster, 2011_

  * Carr-Purcell Meiboom-Gill Relaxation Dispersion (CPMG RD) uses spin-echo pulse trains to suppress relaxation due to exchange processes on the µs-ms timescale.
  * *(a)* The number of spin-echo pulses applied during the fixed relaxation time directly determines the CPMG frequency via ν,,CPMG,, = 1 / (4τ).
    * The applied CPMG pulse train is shown above each relaxation delay (ν,,CPMG,, = 100, 500 and 1100 Hz).
    * These pulses reduce the signal relaxation rate during the relaxation delay by refocusing exchange broadening (i.e., reducing R,,ex,,).
  * *(b)* The observed signal intensity remaining at the end of the TCPMG relaxation delay is used to obtain an effective relaxation rate , where I,,0,, is the signal intensity in the absence of the relaxation delay (i.e., when TCPMG = 0).
  * *(c)* The dispersion Curve reports on dynamics by plotting relaxation rate as a function of refocusing frequency.

== Two-state exchange model ==
  * *Goal*: _Present the simplest and most commonly used model to describe μs-ms dynamics_

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-RD_Parameters/figure-rd_parameters.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-RD_Parameters/figure-rd_parameters.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="300"> </img> </a> 
  
   * *(a) *A single NMR probe (e.g., Ala 12N^H^) is considered to alternate between local structures designated A and B, which have distinct NMR chemical shifts in 1H and/or AX dimensions.
    * Although two signals are shown here, the “minor” B state is not detected directly because its NMR signal is too weak and/or too broad. However, the A↔B exchange yields a quantitative effect on the measured RD Curve of signal A.

*The two-state exchange model requires 4-5 parameters to describe a single RD Curve*
  * *Structural parameters (1 or 2 per NMR probe)*
    # |Δω,,H,,| (rad/s): Magnitude of ^1^H chemical shift difference between A and B states (for MQ Curves only)
    # |Δω,,X,,| (rad/s): Magnitude of ^A^X chemical shift difference between A and B states (AX = ^13^C or ^15^N)
  * *Kinetic parameters (2 per temperature per NMR probe)*
    * Parameters used in fitting equations
      # k,,ex,, (/s): Total exchange rate between state A and B; k,,ex,, = k,,A,, + k,,B,, 
      # P,,A,, (-): Population fraction of state A; P,,A,, = k,,B,, / (k,,A,,+k,,B,,) with P,,A,, + P,,B,, = 1
    * Alternate physical parameterization, which requires knowledge of both k,,ex,, and P,,A,,
      # k,,A,, (/s): Average frequency (not velocity!) of transition from state A to state B
      # k,,B,, (/s): Average frequency (not velocity!) of transition from state B to state A
  * *Relaxation parameter (1 per Curve per NMR probe)*
    # R,,2,,^0^ (Hz): Relaxation rate of the A state in the absence of exchange
  * *(b)* The MQ Curve shown here is simulated using |ΔωH| = 8 Hz, |ΔωX| = 201 Hz, k,,ex,, = 1000 /s, P,,A,, = 90%, and  = 10 Hz.


== Assigning parameters for fitting ==
  * *Goal*: _Fitting requries five parameters per Curve, but often parameters can be shared when Curves are aggregated into Curvesets, which are aggregated into Groups_
    * Details on Curves, Curvesets, and Groups are [Manual#Organizing_Data here]

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/data_management-example/figure-data_management-example.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/data_management-example/figure-data_management-example.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="300"> </img> </a>

_(Figure above) (a) Hierarchical data structures used in GUARDD, (b) example data structure [Manual#Example_parameter_assignment shown here]_

  * Each *Curve* is designated a unique *R,,2,,^0^*
    * R,,2,,^0^ = Transverse relaxation rate in the absence of exchange (Hz)
    * *Assume*: Relaxation rates of states A and B are equal (R,,2A,,^0^ = R,,2B,,^0^)

  * One or more Curves are aggregated into a *Curveset*, which designate the same chemical shift differences *|Δω,,H,,| and |Δω,,X,,|*
    * *Assume*: |Δω,,H,,| (ppm) and |Δω,,X,,| (ppm) are independent of temperature
      * Therefore, each unique temperature yields an independent measure of |Δω,,H,,| and/or |Δω,,X,,|
    * *NMR*: Resonance frequency scales with magnetic field strength
      * Therefore, each unique B,,0,, field yields an independent measure of |Δω,,X,,|
      * See calculations [Manual#Converting_ppm_to_rad/s here]
    * *NMR*: An experiment may be designed to detect a particular quantum coherence
      * Therefore, each unique quantum coherence yields an independent measure of |Δω,,H,,| and/or |Δω,,X,,|
      * Single Quantum (SQ) experiments are sensitive to only |Δω,,H,,| or |Δω,,X,,|
      * Multiple Quantum (MQ) experiments are sensitive to the sum |Δω,,H,, + Δω,,X,,|      
      * See Korzhnev, et al. (2005) for more information: [Manual#References Quantum Coherences in dispersion]

  * One or more Curvesets are aggregated into a *Group*, which designates the kinetic parameters *(P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at each temperature)*
    * *Physics*: Kinetic parameters are determined by experimental conditions
      * E.g., temperature, buffer, sometimes concentration but NOT magnetic field strength
      * Therefore, each repeat condition (same or different B,,0,,) yields an independent measure of P,,A,, and k,,ex,,
    * There are at least *two methods* to specify P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at each temperature
    * Method A - No constraint on rate analysis
      * Define P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at each temperature explicitly
    * Method B - Constrain rate analysis via ΔH and E,,AB,,
      * Define P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at a single temperature, T,,0,,
      * Define ΔH for temperature-dependence of P,,A,, (vant Hoff)
      * Define E,,AB,, for temperature-dependence of k,,A,, and, using ΔH, k,,B,, and therefore k,,ex,, = k,,A,,+k,,B,, (Arrhenius)
    * See calculations [Manual#Arrhenius:_Determining_activation_energy here]

=== Example parameter assignment ===
  * *Goal*: _Check the command window output for itemization of each parameter in a given Group_
    * Use the debugging output option {{{OUTPUT_DEBUG_UPDATE_FIT_PARAMS}}} (in [Manual#Settings Settings window], on by default)

  # Load the data and execute the grid search on exchanging Groups
  # For each Group, the grid search fit is selected, otherwise an individual fit is performed
  # In YES to exchange, the current best fit is evaluated via χ^2^ maps and rate analyses
    * If NO exchange, the {{{NoEx}}} fit is marked for subsequent analysis
  # If fitted values can be optimized, the user supplies new initial conditions and re-evaluates the fit at (3)
  # If fitted values cannot be optimized, the user designates which ones are valid/invalid, if any
  # It is important that invalid parameters be designated as such, lest they be analyzed/displayed in subsequent output
  # The user should enter text to describe the fitting result
    * Especially if there is work to do (e.g., new Grid Search, multi-Curveset fitting, remove noisy data)
  # Once fits are optimized, errors are calculated using Monte Carlo bootstrapping and results are viewed
  # New Groups can be generated to test global motions and/or to refine fit results

==== Display Chi2 Map ====
 * *Goal*: _Browse the results of a grid search or MC error analysis to assess and refine fit_

  * *Key info on features of chi2 maps*
    * The χ^2^ map is a hypersurface with amplitude χ^2^ and one dimension for each independent fitting parameter
      * E.g., 14 parameters yields a 14D hypersurface        
    * Lower value of χ^2^ indicates a more precise fit to the data
    * The goal is to obtain paramters at the *global* minimum of χ^2^
    * Issue: the nonlinear nature of RD yields a "rough" χ^2^ map that can trap the fitting routine in local minima

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-chi2_maps/figure-chi2_maps.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-chi2_maps/figure-chi2_maps.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="200"> </img> </a> 

_(Figure above) The response of χ^2^ to just one parameter, k,,ex,,, produces a 2D slice through the hypersurface to illustrate four commonly encountered shapes that pose distinct challenges in obtaining an accurate fit._


  * *Goal*: _Interpret the *Grid Search* results the <u>Chi2 Map</u> window_
    # Each subplot shows a single parameter on the X-axis, and its different values in different fits
    # Each *black point* corresponds to ONE optimized fit result
      # There are 60 fits in this example (hence 60 points in each subplot), each of which started from a different location in parameter space
      # Those initial locations can be displayed by setting *Results to display*: Initial
    # The *red circle* designates the currently selected fit result
    # The *blue square* designates the best fit from the grid search
    # Clicking *Pick grid fit* will allow selection of any of the grid fits shown
      # The *green diamond* designates the currently selected fit from the displayed grid list
      # Any of these can be added to the list of fits, if desired

===== Select fit from grid search =====
  * *Goal*: _To examine a particular fit from the grid search that is not the min(χ^2^), it must be selected from the list_
  * This is helpful for checking another well in χ^2^ space (e.g., [http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-chi2_maps/figure-chi2_maps.png Figure_C])

  * Tutorial: select fit from grid search [Tutorial#View_Grid_Search_Chi2_Map_for_fit_with_uknown_parameters here]


===== Display Monte Carlo Errors =====
 * *Key info on Monte Carlo analysis*
    * The goal of MC analysis is to generate and fit many *synthetic* datasets which differ from one another by an amount related to the goodness of fit to the original data
    * Each synthetic dataset will have a different set of optimal fit values (e.g., P,,A,,, k,,ex,,)
    * The distribution of fitted values reflects the degree to which the original data define its *own* optimal values
    * Example: A worse optimal fit to the original data yields *more different* MC datasets and therefore *more different* optimal parameter values


<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-monte_carlo/figure-monte_carlo.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-monte_carlo/figure-monte_carlo.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="300"> </img> </a>

_(Figure above) The example data contains 5 observations (black), 5 residuals (red), and 10 synthetic datasets (green squares), each with their own fit (green dotted lines) and set of optimized parameter values_

  * *Goal*: _Interpret the *MC Errors* results the <u>Chi2 Map</u> window_
    # Each subplot shows a single parameter on the X-axis, and its different values in different fits
    # Each *black point* corresponds to ONE optimized fit result to a synthetic MC dataset
      # There are 100 fits in this example (hence 100 points in each subplot), each of which corresponds to a synthetic MC dataset
      # The initial conditions to each fit are given by the best fit to the original data (see *Results to display*: Initial)
    # The *red circle* designates the best fit to the original data
    # Set *Display Mode*: Histogram
    # The gray lines show the hypothetical distributions reflecting "errors" in the data
      # The *mean* of each distribution is from the best fit value to the original data
      # The *standard deviation* of each distribution is the standard deviation from the distribution of MC fitted values
      # Each deviation is reported as the "error" in each fitted parameter (shown in brackets)
    # *Note*: it is usually best to use a *Top%*=100% for MC errors
      * Sometimes anomalous fits yield very large χ^2^, and can be discarded, but this is rare

  * Notes
    * Some paramters plot one point per Group (e.g., P,,A,, or k,,ex,,(37C))
    * Some parameter plot one point per Curveset (e.g., |Δω,,X,,|) and hence multiple points per Group
    * Some paramters *could* plot one point per Curve (e.g., R,,ex,,) but the FIRST Curve is selected by default
    * Otherwise there would be too many points on the plot

  * *Goal*: _Produce table of results for easy browsing_

  * Notes
    * Table is dynamically generated based on the user's selection criteria from an arbitrary set of RD parameters and Curves
      * E.g., only P,,A,, and k,,ex,, at one temperature, instead of all RD parameters for all Curves for all Groups
    * This customized table can be exported to plain-text for publication or external analysis

  * *Button: Export to CSV* → creates two plain-text files (two-column format and one-column format)
    * One is easier for plotting in external programs
    * Another is easier for preparing a publication quality table

  * Tutorial: display results table [Tutorial#View_results_in_table here]

== Tips for optimal use ==

=== Program tips ===
  * Save frequently
  * Drawing windows is relatively slow
    * Use the main display window to only update displays of interest
  * Use a CPU monitor application to see when GUARDD is processing results (e.g., fitting, drawing windows, exporting files)
  * Do not make other changes when performing grid search or error estimates
    * Data can be viewed but not altered
    * This is because data structures are stored before the batch run (or a single grid search or single error estimation) then re-saved upon completion of a batch step or single grid search or single error estimation  

=== Fitting tips ===
  * Usually dispersions with larger R,,ex,, have a more well-defined solution
    * Small R,,ex,, and/or noisy data are usually accompanied by challenges in fitting

  * If unsure about the fit, then don't interpret fitted parameters quantitatively
    * Additional inaccurate information can obscure proper interpretation of dynamics
    * A poor fit to the two-state model may indicate more complex exchange, such as three-state
    * Note this residue, and consider other fitting equations or more complex exchange models (unfortunately, not available in GUARDD v.2011.09.11)

  * Three solutions for ill-defined fits
    # Select one of the fits, but mark the ill-defined parameters as “Not OK,”  thus preventing their mis-interpretation in subsequent analyses.
    # Alter the Group and re-fit. One may remove noisy Curves and/or add additional Curvesets to help constrain the values of k,,ex,, and P,,A,,.
    # Acquire more data and re-fit the new Group. The RD Simulator can help determine optimal conditions of temperature, magnetic field strength, and/or quantum coherence for efficient use of spectrometer time, [Manual#RD_Simulator here]

  * Check for outliers in fitted data
    * Check sequence mapping for outliers
    * Check χ2 and fits for those outliers
    * What type of exchange do proximal residues exhibit?

  * Make sure fits which show no exchange have “NoEx” model selected as best

  * Check neighboring residues
    * Check dispersions for neighboring residues to get an idea of the type of motions one may expect in that region of the structure
    * If there is concerted motion, then k,,ex,, and Pa (and their temperature-dependence Ea(A → B), Ea (B → A), dH, dS) will be the same (or close) for residues close in structure
    * Note: There is no requirement that neighboring residues be similar though

  * k,,ex,, is most sensitive fitting parameter
    * Use the largest number of grid search steps
    * k,,ex,, should increase with temperature (e.g., Arrhenius)
    * P,,A,, may increase (ΔH < 0), decrease (ΔH > 0) or remain constant (ΔH=0) with temperature

=== GUARDD approach to fast exchange and PhiEx ===
  * *Issue*: _In fast exchange (k,,ex,, >> Δν = Δω / (2π)), the quantities P,,A,,P,,B,, and Δω are correlated, and therefore cannot be independently defined_

  * *Solution*: sometimes although neither quantity can be defined independently, the quantity Φ,,ex,,^X^ = P,,A,,P,,B,,Δω,,X,,^2^ = P,,A,,(1-P,,A,,)Δω,,X,,^2^ , where X refers to the X nucleus, can be well-defined (Luz, 1963; Ishima, 1999)

  * Examine Φ,,ex,,^X^ in the <u>Chi2 Map</u> window to help assess the sensitivity of the final fit to either initial conditions (via grid search) or to noise in the data (via Monte Carlo error estimation)
    * In some cases, the parameters P,,A,, and Δω,,X,, are relatively sensitive to initial conditions (wide χ^2^ maps), whereas Φ,,ex,, is relatively less sensitive (more narrow χ^2^ map), which may indicate that it is reasonable to interpret Φ,,ex,,, but not P,,A,,.

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/GUARDD-Update-2011.09.13--01.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/GUARDD-Update-2011.09.13--01.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="200"> </img> </a>

  * The <u>Chi2 Map</u> window displays a correlation plot of the optimized values of Δω,,X,,^2^ and P,,A,,P,,B,,. In fast exchange, a strong correlation between these parameters yields a line of points, facilitating detection of fast exchange. 

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/GUARDD-Update-2011.09.06--02.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/GUARDD-Update-2011.09.06--02.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="200"> </img> </a>

  * Check for fast exchange via the Fit RD window by comparing values of k,,ex,, and Δω as well as the exchange parameter α, which indicates fast exchange in the range 1.0 to 2.0 (Millet et al., 2000). 

== Limitations ==
  * Liabilities of linkage to MATLAB
    # GUARDD is slower than if it were coded using C or Python, for example
      # MATLAB is an interpreted language
      # Graphical interface uses Java
      # Drawing the display, while reading or writing large session files, or while fitting data
    # Malfunctions in MATLAB may hinder functionality of GUARDD
      # However, enhancements to MATLAB may imbue enhancements to GUARDD
    # User must have access to MATLAB (i.e., GUARDD is not a standalone program)
      # However, MATLAB is a convenient cross-platform solution for dissemination of software
    # Cannot be run using Octave, which can run many other MATLAB programs [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ link]
      # Octave does not support the graphical user interface that is a key feature of GUARDD [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/FAQ.html#MATLAB-compatibility link]
      # For what its worth, Octave supports a distinct GUI library called “Zenity” [http://octave.sourceforge.net/zenity/ link]

  # Limitations of GUARDD functionality
    # Exchange model is restricted to two-state using the all-timescales MQ Carver-Richards-Jones formulation
      # No simplifications assuming skewed populations (P,,B,, < P,,A,,) (Ishima, 1999)
      # No simplifications assuming fast-exchange (k,,ex,, > Δν)
    # No three-site exchange
    # No ZQ or DQ coherences
    # No pressure-dependence of RD
    # No Anti-TROSY/TROSY analysis
    # No temperature-dependence via transition state theory
    # No error analysis options: jacknife, covariance matrix method

=== Grid search ===
  * *Motivation*
    * Nonlinear nature of RD phenomena makes the relationship between χ^2^ and fitting parameters (*p*) difficult to predict
    * Optimization algorithms often “fail” by finding a local minimum of χ^2^, which is sensitive to initial fitting conditions, instead of the intended global minimum of χ^2^  
  * *Goal*: _Fit data multiple times to assess sensitivity of final fit to initial conditions_
  
  * *Six-dimensional (6D) grid search*
    # |Δω,,H,,|
    # |Δω,,X,,|
    # P,,A,,^0^ = P,,A,,(T,,0,,), where T,,0,, is a specified temperature (e.g., 25C)
    # k,,ex,,^0^ = k,,ex,,(T,,0,,), where T,,0,, is a specfied temperature (e.g., 25C)
    # E,,AB,, (only for consraining rates via Arrhenius)
    # ΔΗ (only for consraining rates via Arrhenius)

  * *Each point specifies initial conditions for the fit, as follows*
    * Δω values are used for every Curveset in the Group
      * Note: this may be sub-optimal since each Curveset can have a different Δω value
    * If constrain rates is NOT used
      * P,,A,,^0^ is used for all temperatures in the Group
      * k,,ex,,^0^ value is used at temperature T,,0,, and increased by 2x for each increase in 10C from T,,0,, (i.e., k,,ex,,(T) = k,,ex,,^0^^(T-T,,0,,)/10^)
    * If constrain rates IS used
      * P,,A,,(T) determined using P,,A,,^0 and ΔH
      * k,,ex,,(T) determined using k,,ex,,^0^ and E,,AB,,
    * R,,2,,^0^ is always the minimum value of the observed R,,2,, in the Curve


*Recommendations on bounds at T,,0,, = 25C*

|| 		||*Δω,,H,,(ppm)*||*Δω,,Χ,,(ppm)*||*P,,A,,^0^(%)*||*k,,ex,,^0^(/s)*	|| E,,AB,, (kcal/mol)	|| ΔH (kcal/mol)	||

|| _Very Large_	|| 20-50	|| 500?		|| _Very challenging to fit_ 	||

  * *Unsorted notes*
    * k,,ex,, seems to be a very sensitive parameter, use the most points here
    * Sometimes MATLAB does not alter Δω values for multiple Curvesets
    * E,,AB,, and ΔH can be very difficult to optimize via grid search
  * *Location in code*

=== Monte Carlo error estimation ===
  * *Motivation*: _The final fit to RD data are sometimes very sensitive to noise in the data_
  * *Goal*: _Generate and fit multiple synthetic data to assess sensitivity of final fit to noise in data_

<a href="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-monte_carlo/figure-monte_carlo.png"> <img src="http://web.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~ikleckne/GUARDD/images/manual/figure-monte_carlo/figure-monte_carlo.png" alt="[UNLOADED IMAGE]" width="300"> </img> </a>

_Monte Carlo procedure generates and fits synthetic data consistent with observed residuals (related to noise)_

*Procedure*

  (1) Calculate residuals for each ν,,CPMG,, value in a given Curve

    ε(ν,,CPMG,,) = R,,2Eff,,^Obs^(ν,,CPMG,,) - R,,2Eff,,^Calc^(ν,,CPMG,,)

  (2a) The residuals are used to create a normal distribution for the Curve with mean and variance

  Norm(mean(ε), var(ε))

  (2b) Alternatively, the experimental errors σ(R,,2Eff,,^Obs^) can be used

  Norm(mean(σ), var(σ))

  (3) Generate a synthetic dispersion Curve using the fit at each ν,,CPMG,, plus a random sample from the distribution

    R,,2Eff,,^Synth^ = R,,2Eff,,^Calc^(ν,,CPMG,,) + Sample( Norm(mean(ε), var(ε)) )

    _or using Norm(mean(σ), var(σ))_

  (4) Repeat for each Curve in the Group such that a synthetic Group is produced

  (5) Fit the synthetic Group using initial conditions from the best fit of the actual data.

  (6) Repeat (3)-(5) multiple times (default 100x, can be changed in settings "Nmc")

  This yields 100 synthetic Groups and 100 sets of optimized fit parameters

  (7) Calculate the error in a given parameter as the standard deviation of the optimized fit parameter from its 100 element distribution

  (8) Errors in subsequent quantities (e.g., k,,A,,, k,,B,,, ln(k,,A,,), etc.) are estimated using propagation of error assuming all parameters are uncorrelated (zero covariance)
