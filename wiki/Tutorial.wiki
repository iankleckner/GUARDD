== Contents == 
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

== Goals == 
  * Load data from file
  * Create groups for fitting  
    * Iso-tempertaure
    * Multi-temperature  
  * Select residues with exchange
  * Fit exchanging data via grid search
  * Select best fit from grid search  
  * Compute errors with Monte Carlo
  * Determine which parameters which are OK
  * View results via display cluster
  * View results via table
  * Simulate data and import to GUARDD
  * Fit simulated data
  * Export all groups


== Requirements ==
  # 60-90 min
  # Matlab software [http://www.mathworks.com/ Mathworks]
  # GUARDD program [http://code.google.com/p/guardd/downloads/list download]
    # Matlab '*'.m and *.fig files
  # Tutorial files for this example [http://code.google.com/p/guardd/downloads/list download]
    # tutorial-data/
      # LIST DATA FILES
    # tutorial-figures/
      # Screen capture images linked within this tutorial
      # tutorial-output/
      # Output figures for some plots produced during tutorial 


== General tutorial notes ==  
  # GUARDD utilizes multiple GUI windows (may need to be resized)
    # Higher monitor resolution helps (1024x768 minimum)
  # GUARDD main window *must remain open* (it controls other GUI elements) [Figure] 
  # "Tooltips" are revealed by hovering mouse cursor over buttons, tables, etc.
  # Statistics χ^2^ and SSE are considered equivalent in this tutorial (see [Manual])
  # *Notation*: dwH = Δω,,H,,, Chi2 = χ^2^
