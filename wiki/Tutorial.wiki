== Contents == 
<wiki:toc max_depth="5" />

== Goals == 
  * Load data from file
  * Create groups for fitting  
    * Iso-tempertaure
    * Multi-temperature  
  * Select residues with exchange
  * Fit exchanging data via grid search
  * Select best fit from grid search  
  * Compute errors with Monte Carlo
  * Determine which parameters which are OK
  * View results via display cluster
  * View results via table
  * Simulate data and import to GUARDD
  * Fit simulated data
  * Export all groups


== Requirements ==
  # 60-90 min
  # Matlab software [http://www.mathworks.com/ Mathworks]
  # GUARDD program [http://code.google.com/p/guardd/downloads/list download]
    # Matlab '*'.m and *.fig files
  # Tutorial files for this example [http://code.google.com/p/guardd/downloads/list download]
    # tutorial-data/
      # LIST DATA FILES
    # tutorial-figures/
      # Screen capture images linked within this tutorial
      # tutorial-output/
      # Output figures for some plots produced during tutorial 


== General notes ==  
  # GUARDD utilizes multiple GUI windows (may need to be resized)
    # Higher monitor resolution helps (1024x768 minimum)
  # GUARDD main window *must remain open* (it controls other GUI elements) [Figure] 
  # Check Matlab command window for additional output
  # GUARDD is sometimes slow. Turn on CPU monitor to see when program is processing
    # *Win*: Ctrl+Alt+Del, click _Task Manager_
    # *Mac*: ?    
  # "Tooltips" are revealed by hovering mouse cursor over buttons, tables, etc.

== Notation ==  
  * NMR = Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
  * GUARDD = Graphical User-friendly Analysis of Relaxation Dispersion Data
  * RD = Relaxation Disperion  
  * dwH = Δω,,H,,, = ^1^H chemical shift difference between states A and B (ppm, rad/s, Hz)
  * dwX = Δω,,X,,, = ^A^X chemical shift difference between states A and B (ppm, rad/s, Hz)
  * P,,A,, = Population fraction of A state (fraction, %)
  * k,,ex,, = k,,A,, + k,,B,, = Total exchange rate between states (/s)
  * R,,2,,^0^ = Transverse relaxation rate in the absence of exchange (Hz)
  * SQ = Single Quantum (signal detected in NMR)
  * MQ = Multiple Quantum (signal detected in NMR)

  * GUI = Graphical User Interface  
  * <u>Underlined</u> items are GUARDD window titles
  * *Boldface* items are commands (buttons, menus) and important points

  * MC = Monte Carlo (randomization method used here for error analysis)
  * Chi2 = χ^2^ = Goodness of fit metric (smaller value indicates better fit)
    * Statistics χ^2^ and SSE are considered equivalent in this tutorial (see [Manual])  

== Tutorial ==

=== Download and unpack files ===
  # Download files [http://code.google.com/p/guardd/downloads/list download]
  # Unpack files
    # E.g., "/home/user/Desktop/" or "C:\My_Favorite_Folder\"
  # Ensure proper directory structure
    # GUARDD/

=== Start GUARDD ===
  # Start *Matlab*  
  # Open Matlab command window: *Desktop...Command Window*
  # Navigate to GUARDD/ directory and start program
    # <u>Matlab command window</u>: _cd 'c:\My_Favorite_Folder'_
    # <u>Matlab command window</u>: _GUARDDD_
  # *Important*: Main window must remain open (it controls all other GUI windows)
  # Check Matlab command window for additional output

=== Load data ===
  * *Goal*: _Get RD data into the program for analysis_
  * *Tip*: _A variety of input types are available (see [Manual])_

  # <u>Main</u>
    # *Input...Data manager...*
  # <u>Data Manager</u>
    # *Input...Script...*
      # tutorial/data/GUARDD-Data-ApoTRAP-Kleckner.txt            
    # *Input...Sequence...*
      # tutorial/data/TRAP-Ste-A26I-AAseq.txt
  # 14 datasets loaded    
    # 600 and 800 MHz
    # 25, 32, and 37^o^C
    # SQ and MQ coherence


=== Create groups for fitting ===
  * *Goal*: _Aggregate RD curves from the same NMR signal (assignment) for group fitting_

  # <u>Data Manager</u>    
    # *Group...Generate from subset of data...*
  # <u>Create Groups</u>
    # Constrain residue to Ile
      # Click the checkbox
      # Type _Ile_
    # Constrain temperature to 25^o^C
      # Click the checkbox
      # Type _25_
    # Click *Generate groups*
  # <u>Data Manager</u>
    # *Group...Generate from subset of data...*
  # <u>Create Groups</u>
    # Constrain index to 22
      # Click the checkbox
      # Type _22_
  # <u>Data Manager</u>
    # *Group...Sort groups*
  # Close the <u>Data Manager</u> window

=== Select residues with exchange ===
  * *Goal*: _Determine which groups exhibit flexibility, and warrant further analysis_  

  # <u>Main</u>
    # Click *Refresh* to show loaded groups
    # Use *<* and *>* to cycle through groups
    # Check *Exch?* if the data are not flat (i.e., R,,ex,, > 0)
      # Only Ile 61δ,,1,, and Ile 68δ,,1,, do not exhibit exchange

=== Fit group manually ===
  * *Goal*: _Fit one group manually via Fit RD window_

=== Fit exchanging data via grid search ===
=== Select best fit from grid search ===
=== Compute errors with Monte Carlo ===
=== Determine which parameters which are OK ===
=== View results via display cluster ===
=== View results via table ===
=== Simulate data and import to GUARDD ===
=== Fit simulated data ===
=== Export all groups ===
